 
Write a program that does the following

Find the area of a square of side 14cm.
Also, find the cost of painting the square if the paint costs is 7$ cm/sq.
Initialise the following variables in your program and use them in the computation
  s to store the length of side the square
  area to store the area of the square
  cost to store the cost of painting
  
Output 
area and
cost to the console on separate lines.
Note: Include the character "$" with the 
cost without any space while printing the output.


code:--

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int s = 14 ;
  int area = s *s ;
  int cost = area * 7 ;
  printf("%d \n", area ); 
  printf("%d", cost); 
  printf("$"); 
  return 0;
}

output:--

196 
1372$

 In C, when you divide an 'int' by another 'int', you get only the integer value of the quotient.

For example, 3 / 2 would be 1, and not 1.5.
It is rounded down to the nearest integer.

Write a program that does the following:
Display the sum, product, and quotient of 2 integers: 

−50 & 
40.

Initialise the following variables in your program and use them in the computation

Variable a and assign it the value 
−50

Variable b and assign it the value 
40

Variables 
sum, 
product and 
quotient - assign the relevant values to them


Note - 
sum, 
product and
quotient need to be integers
Output 
sum, 
product and 
quotient to the console on separate lines


code:--


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a = -50 ;
  int b = 40  ;
  int sum = a + b ;
  int product = a * b ;
  int quotient = a / b;
  printf("%d \n", sum); 
  printf("%d \n", product ); 
  printf("%d \n", quotient); 
  return 0;
}


output:--

-10 
-2000 
-1

Suppose we have a value with a lot of digits after the decimals and they are useless in the output we are
providing we can use the %f format specifier to trim decimal places according to our requirements.

for eg -
      double int = 1.101000000
      printf("%0.3f", int) \\0.3f - this specifies how many digits we want after  
      output - 1.101                the decimal in our case 3.
      
Write a program for the following -
Declare a variable num and assign it the value 4.4587658.
Display the variable with only 2 decimal places.


code:--

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  double num = 4.4587658 ;
  printf("%0.2f", num );
  return 0;
}

output:--

4.46
