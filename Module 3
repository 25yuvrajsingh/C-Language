Let us revisit our favorite rectangle and its area problem

Write a program that does the following

Declare 2 variables
length and
width
In this problem - accept 2 user-defined inputs from the console and initialize these values 
ℎ
length and 
ℎ
width
Create another integer variable 
area - compute the area of the rectangle and store it as 
area
Output 
area to the console
Sample 1:
Input
Output
10
23
Area of the rectangle is: 230

Code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int length, width;
  int area ;
  scanf("%d", &length);
  scanf("%d", &width);
  area = length * width;
  printf("Area of the rectangle is: %d", area);
  return 0;
}


Area of the rectangle is: 230
