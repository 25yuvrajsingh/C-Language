Write a program that does the following

Find out and display the area of a rectangle of sides 45 and 76 respectively.
Declare variables 
length, 
width and 
area and assign the relevant values to them
Make sure to add some text as well, so that the person reading the output knows what the output means.

code:--

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int length = 45 ; 
  int width = 76; 
  int area = length*width;
  printf ("The Area of the given rectangle is %d", area ); 
  return 0;
}

output:-

The Area of the given rectangle is 3420

For printing double datatype we use "%lf" format specifier.

Write a program that does the following:

Find the area of a circle whose radius is 8.9 cm. Take pi = 3.14
Declare variables 
radius, 
pi and 
area and assign the relevant values to them
Note: Area of a circle is 
Pi
radius 
2


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  double pi = 3.14 ;
  double radius = 8.9 ;      //radius has to be declared as a 'double'
  double area = pi * radius * radius;
  printf("The Area of the given Circle is %lf", area );                              // %lf   is for double specifier
  return 0;
}

The Area of the given Circle is 248.719400
